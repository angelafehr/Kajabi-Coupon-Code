## How To Make a Discount Code on Kajabi?

So, now comes the question: when you have successfully created your account on Kajabi, and now want to sell your courses.

And initially, you want to give some discounts to attract new students, how would you do that?

Here is a step-by-step guide.

### **Step 1: Access the Coupons Section**

- From your Kajabi dashboard, navigate to the **Sales** tab on the left-hand menu.
- Click on **Coupons** to view existing coupons or create a new one.
- Select **+ New Coupon** to start the process.

### **Step 2: Choose Coupon Type**

- Decide between **Single Coupon** or **Bulk Codes**:
    - **Single Coupon**: One code (e.g., "SAVE20") for multiple customers to use, ideal for broad promotions.
    - **Bulk Codes**: Generate multiple unique single-use codes (1 to 1,000) for specific customers or organizations, perfect for licenses or exclusive offers.
- Select your preferred option from the toggle or dropdown menu.

### **Step 3: Configure Coupon Details**

- **Coupon Name**: Enter a descriptive internal name for tracking (e.g., "BlackFriday2025"). This is for your reference and not visible to customers.
- **Coupon Code**: Create a custom code (e.g., "SPRING25") that customers will enter at checkout. Ensure it’s memorable and relevant to your promotion.
- **Discount Type**:
    - Choose **Percent Off** (e.g., 20%) or **Amount Off** (e.g., $50).
    - For a **100% off** (free) coupon, select **Percent Off** and set it to 100%. Note that customers may still need to provide payment details for subscriptions.
- **Discount Value**: Input the percentage or dollar amount. If choosing **Amount Off**, select the currency matching your offer (e.g., USD, EUR).
- **Duration** (for subscriptions or multi-pay offers):
    - **Once**: Applies to the first payment only.
    - **Repeating**: Discounts multiple payments (specify the number of months, e.g., 3 months for a weekly/monthly subscription).
    - **Forever**: Discounts all payments for the entire billing period.
- **Expiration Date** (optional): Set a date for the coupon to expire. Once expired, used, or deleted, the code cannot be reused.
- **Quantity** (for Bulk Codes only): Enter the number of unique codes to generate (1 to 1,000).

### **Step 4: Attach the Coupon to an Offer**

- In the **Included Offers** section, select the specific **Offer(s)** the coupon applies to. Offers are your packaged products (e.g., a course or membership) created in the **Products > Offers** section.
    - Click to add existing offers or create a new one if needed.
    - Note: Coupons only apply to the selected offers and not to upsells within those offers.
- If you duplicate an offer linked to a coupon, the duplicated offer will automatically inherit the coupon.

### **Step 5: Save and Review**

- Double-check all settings, as **coupons cannot be edited once created**. If changes are needed, you’ll have to delete and recreate the coupon.
- Click **Save** or **Create Coupon** to finalize.
- For Bulk Codes, you’ll see a list of generated codes. Export them as a .CSV file (via **Export All Codes**) for sharing with partners or customers.

### **Step 6: Share the Coupon**

- **Manual Application**: Customers can enter the coupon code in the coupon field on the right sidebar of the offer’s checkout page.
- **Automatic Application**:
    - In the Coupons section, locate your coupon and find the **Discount Link** button next to the included offer.
    - Click it to copy a checkout URL with the coupon code pre-applied (e.g., yourdomain.com/checkout?coupon=SPRING25).
    - Share this link in emails, social media posts, or sales pages to ensure the discount is automatically applied, reducing customer errors.
- Tip: Highlight the discount in your marketing (e.g., “Use code SPRING25 for 25% off!” or share the discount link for seamless checkout).

### **Step 7: Test and Monitor**

- Test the coupon by using the discount link or manually entering the code at checkout to ensure it applies correctly.
- Monitor coupon usage in the **Sales > Coupons** section to track redemptions and performance.
- If issues arise (e.g., code not working), verify the expiration date, offer compatibility, or contact Kajabi’s support via [**billing@kajabi.com**](mailto:billing@kajabi.com).

## What If My Kajabi Coupon Code Is Not Working?

If your Kajabi coupon doesn’t work, try these troubleshoots steps once.

- **📅 Verify Validity**: Confirm the coupon is active and hasn’t passed its expiration date.
- **🔍 Check Code Accuracy**: Ensure no typos or stray spaces sneak into the code when inputting it.
- **🎯 Confirm Applicability**: Note that some discounts are exclusive to new users or certain subscription tiers.
- **🔄 Single-Use Limit**: Used codes may not work again if they’re designed for one-time use.
